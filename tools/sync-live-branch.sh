# This exists because doing it by hand went wrong twice. Copying only
# `tools css js` left pages/ behind, so a label edited on the production branch
# never reached the live site; and running `git checkout <branch> -- ...` over an
# uncommitted tree silently discarded work in progress. Both are avoided here:
# the tree must be clean before anything happens, and every source path is
# copied, not a hand-picked subset.
